# Performance Testing

The chapter outlines the importance of performance testing in ensuring a good user experience by maintaining a performant website. It emphasizes that performance testing, while different from regression or system testing, is essential to prevent providing users with a subpar experience due to slow or unresponsive websites.

Key points of the chapter include:

Purpose of Performance Testing:
Performance testing is crucial to safeguard users from poor website experiences caused by performance issues, such as slow load times or laggy interactions.

Key Performance Metrics:
Important metrics include page weight, number of requests, Time to First Byte (TTFB), load time, and scrolling performance, which all impact the user's ability to interact with the site effectively.

Setting a Performance Budget:
A performance budget is determined by setting target values for key metrics and ensuring that they are met consistently before merging code or deploying. It involves managing trade-offs and prioritizing which features to include based on their performance impact.

Creating a Performance Budget:
Performance budgets can be set by benchmarking against competitors or industry averages. Tools like HTTPArchive can provide insights into average web metrics to set a competitive baseline.

Performance Budget Items:
Budget items include raw metrics like page weight and the number of HTTP requests, as well as timing metrics like Time to First Byte and Time to Start Render. There are also hybrid metrics such as Google's PageSpeed Score and the Speed Index, which combine various indicators into a single score.

Automating Performance Tests:
Automating performance testing can be done using tools like Grunt PageSpeed and Grunt Perfbudget, which integrate performance testing into the development workflow, enabling continuous monitoring and control over the site's performance.

Conclusion:
The chapter concludes that with the right performance testing in place and adherence to a well-considered performance budget, development teams can confidently improve and expand their websites without compromising on performance.

In summary, performance testing is presented as an integral part of the development process that helps ensure that the user experience remains at the forefront of development efforts, by avoiding performance degradation as websites evolve and grow.
