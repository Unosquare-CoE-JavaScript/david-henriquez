# Alpha Project

- Modular content
We were big fans of Atomic Design, a methodology created by Brad Frost, and wanted to reuse small components rather than creating dozens, or even hundreds, of unique bands.
- Comprehensive testing
Weâ€™d been burned too many times by large chunks of frontend code being merged into master, breaking code written months prior. So we were determined to test our design system with the same level of coverage that the application level had.
- Streamlined processes
We wanted to mirror the Git flow system that worked so well at the application level, but we needed to break feature branches into smaller, component-sized code chunks. We also wanted to automate error-prone manual processes we had been doing in the past, like updating style guides, creating icon fonts, and deploying new code.
- Exhaustive documentation
With a large team of frontend developers, backend developers, designers, marketing managers, ops, and various product owners, we had a huge audience. We wanted to make sure that whatever we built had documentation that met each one of their needs.
