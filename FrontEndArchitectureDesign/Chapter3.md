# The Pillars of Frontend Architecture

- The Code Pillar: This pillar emphasizes the importance of setting standards for the code that developers write. It focuses on the approach towards HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that comprise the building blocks of a website, ensuring that they are crafted in line with the overall design system.

- The Process Pillar: This pillar addresses the need for efficient and error-free development workflows, considering the complex build processes and tools used in modern web development. It also touches on the shift from traditional development practices to more contemporary methods like designing in the browser and creating responsive HTML prototypes, necessitating a corresponding evolution in the development process.

- The Testing Pillar: The sustainability and scalability of the design system are underlined here, highlighting the importance of testing to ensure new code does not disrupt or degrade the existing system. This pillar explores different testing methods and emphasizes the value of understanding these methods to facilitate better communication with various teams involved in the project.

- The Documentation Pillar: The final pillar stresses the importance of concurrent documentation with development to avoid knowledge gaps when team dynamics change. It suggests looking into different types of documentation, tools that ease publication, and considering the needs of the end users who will utilize the documentation.
