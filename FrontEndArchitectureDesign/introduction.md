on May 25, 2010 a few years after iphone becomes viral, we found an article called Responsive Web Design it described a method for creating a new breed of website that would respond to the size of the userâ€™s device and mold itself to that viewport.

- Fluid grids
  -Percentage-based widths rather than fixed-pixel dimensions.
- Flexible images
