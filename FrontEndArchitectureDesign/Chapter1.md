# The Discipline of Frontend Architecture

Frontend architecture is a collection of tools and processes that aims to improve the quality of frontend code while creating a more efficient and sustainable workflow

The frontend architect's role involves:

- Design: Rather than making ad-hoc decisions on the appearance and structure, the frontend architect defines the overarching design philosophy and system. This ensures consistency across the project and sets the standard for all frontend developers to follow. The aim is to add value with each line of code, rather than contributing to unnecessary bloat.

- Planning: The planning stage outlines the workflow for development, from writing code to deploying it to production. This can involve various tools and processes like version control, task runners, CSS processors, and automation. The frontend architect's goal is to create a smooth process that minimizes human error and maximizes efficiency.

- Oversight: The frontend architect also oversees the project continuously, adapting the processes as needed to respond to changing requirements and improve the workflow.

frontend developers write for the end-users, while frontend architects writes for the development team, creating tools and processes to aid their work.

## Adopting an Architectural Proces

Just like other disciplines before it, frontend architecture has had to fight a battle of priorities. While we canâ€™t imagine why anyone would start building a skyscraper without first consulting an architect, that is in fact how most large web projects start.
