# Css

We work in an industry based on open standards, open source software, open information, and open learning. The tools and techniques we use may be changing at an incredibly fast pace, but working in such an open industry is the key reason weâ€™re able to keep up with them.

As a frontend architect, you might not need to know every tiny CSS bug in some obscure version of Opera mini, but you do need to understand the major trends in CSS, and be able to put together a plan that will set your team up for success

you also can implement some principles in CSS

- Single Responsibility Principle:
  The single responsibility principle states that everything you create should be created for a single, focused reason. The styles you apply to a given selector should be created for a single purpose, and should do that single purpose extremely well.
- Single Source of Truth
  The single source of truth approach takes the single responsibility theory to the next level in that not only is a class created for a single purpose, but also the styles applied to that class come from one single source.
- Component Modifiers
  component modifiers (also called skins or subcomponents, depending on the methodology you subscribe to) allow you to create multiple variations of a component to be used in various circumstances.

## Conclusion

This chapter covered just a small sample of the different CSS techniques that you might use to create a maintainable codebase, including the following:

Separating container from content
Defining roles and responsibilities of layouts versus components
Using single, flat selectors on all of your markup
Using other principles, such as the single responsibility principle, single source of truth, and content modifiers
