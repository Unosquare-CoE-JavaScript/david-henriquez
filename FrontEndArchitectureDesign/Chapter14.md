# Red Hat Testing

This chapter focuses on the use of PhantomCSS, a tool for visual regression testing in web development, particularly as it was used in a project at Red Hat. Hereâ€™s a brief summary:

PhantomCSS's Role and Tools Used:

PhantomCSS Integration: It combines a headless browser (PhantomJS), a scripting library (CasperJS), and an image comparison engine (ResembleJS) for visual regression testing.
Automating with Grunt: The process is automated using Grunt, despite some initial challenges with outdated Grunt PhantomCSS packages.
Setting Up and Using the Tools:

Installation and Configuration: Instructions are provided for installing a well-maintained version of Grunt PhantomCSS and setting it up in Gruntfile.js with various options like mismatchTolerance, screenshots, results, viewportSize, etc.
Testing Approach: The testing involves navigating to web pages using CasperJS, taking screenshots of components, and comparing these with baseline images using PhantomCSS.
Practical Application and Customizations:

Test Execution: Tests are run for different components, capturing various states like hover effects, and compared against baseline images to detect changes.
Handling Failing Tests: The chapter discusses how to deal with failing tests, which could indicate unintended global changes or necessary updates to multiple components.
Customizing the Workflow: The author customized PhantomCSS to better suit their project's needs, like placing baseline images in component folders and testing components individually.
Conclusion:
The chapter concludes with reflections on how these tests enhanced the development process, allowing for confident growth and management of the design system, ensuring consistency, and preventing regressions.

This approach highlights the importance of visual regression testing in maintaining design consistency and quickly identifying unintended changes in front-end development.
