# WorkFlow

The chapter talks about the evolution of the web development workflow and its implications for the frontend development process.

Old vs. New Workflow:

The old workflow, described as matching markup to a PSD file, is considered outdated. It is no longer sufficient for frontend developers to merely "prettify" HTML.
The new workflow is iterative and collaborative, involving UX, design, development, and frontend development from the start. This method focuses on in-browser solutions rather than static designs.
Key Aspects of the New Workflow:

Requirements: Gathering detailed requirements from a mix of disciplines to spot potential issues early in the development process.
Prototyping: Iterating through designs and frontend solutions in the browser, allowing for continuous feedback and refinement before moving into development.
Development: With a well-tested design and necessary markup already in place, developers can efficiently integrate and display data without needing to tweak the frontend further.
Frontend Workflow Specifics:

- Provisioning: Streamlining the setup process for new developers to get them working on the code as quickly as possible.
Local Environment Setup: Simplifying the process of setting up a local development environment, ensuring clear instructions are available.
- Story Writing: Creating focused, actionable tasks that reflect changes to the design system, rather than just page updates, to prevent conflicts and ensure system resilience.
- Development Process: Using a feature branch and pull request model to facilitate code review and maintain high-quality contributions to the codebase.
Distribution: Deciding whether to commit compiled assets directly or use continuous integration tools to handle this process, with the latter providing consistency and avoiding merge conflicts.

The chapter emphasizes the need for a streamlined, modern workflow that fosters collaboration, emphasizes early and continuous testing, and ensures that the frontend development aligns with the overall system's architecture and long-term maintainability.
