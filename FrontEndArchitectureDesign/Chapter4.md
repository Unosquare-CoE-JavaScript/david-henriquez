# HTML

we have different approach we can use for Html

- Modular Markup: 100% Automation, 100% Control
  Theutopian state that we are all striving for is a situation where every line of HTML on our site is programmatically created, yet we as frontend developers have full control over the templates and processes used to create that markup.

- OOCSS Approach (Object-Oriented CSS)

The two main principles of OOCSS are to separate structure and skin, and to separate container and content.

- SMACSS Approach

Although it shares many similarities to OOCSS, SMACSS is an approach differentiated by the way it breaks the system of styles into five specific categories:

- Base
  How markup would look without classes applied to it
- Layout
  Dividing the pages up into regions
- Module
  The modular, reusable parts of your design
- State
  Describes the way that modules or layouts look under given states or contexts
- Theme
  An optional layer of visual appearance that lets you swap out different themes

-BEM Approach
BEM is the third methodology we are going to look at, and is on the other side of the spectrum from SMACSS. BEM is simply a class naming convention. Instead of dictating the structure of your CSS, it only suggests that every element is labeled with a class that describes the following:

- Block
The name of the parent component
- Element
The name of the element inside of the block
- Modifier
Any modifier associated with the block or element
